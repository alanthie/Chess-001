# Developing a learning chess program in C++

Currently have the basic structure of the 1st feature set.

This is a work in progress.

## *First feature set expected:*  
Learning players using genetical algorithm.  
Persistence of all objects.  
Variable board size (ex: 6x6 board or 255x255).  
 Best games database for discovery of better predictors and classifiers as time goes.  
 Endgame tablebase genarator for variable sized board.  
 No manual fine tuning of parameters.  
 Hiearchical decomposition of the problem.  
 Splitting of intensive computation into multi-threads.  
  
## *Next feature set:*  
 Distribution of the learning algorithm on the Web (unlimited number of helper agents).
